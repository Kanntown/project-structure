         method is a way spammers harvest email addresses, so...

    <!-- Well done here. 

         The values for each anchor are good, especially because they
         will show up in a url bar when clicked:

         resume.html#skills

         That's kind of an added bonus for user interface and 
         experience. 

         Remember, you could use an unordered list for your navigation
         which may help styling. Or, perhaps, you'll find a way to
         style this without using a list. :)

      <!-- So, this is interesting ... you are actually using header
           in a proper way as spec documents allow it to be used. A
           header /can/ be used multiple times.

           One thought, though - - there is no need to over-code in
           this case. 

           What you've done in using the header within the section
           is probably ideal for, say, a news article on a web page
           or a blog entry. 

           Because this section is pretty simple, the h2 really
           handles describing the header of the section. But in a 
           really detailed page with many sections, it wouldn't 
           necessarily be a bad thing to incorporate.

           You certainly have not done anything wrong here. This is a
           perfect example of the judgment calls I talk about all the
           time in class. Is the extra code necessary? Sometimes it
           is, sometimes it isn't. 

           Nice way to think outside (or inside?) the box!

      <!-- Going back to the idea of a detailed section ... here you
           might benefit from sectioning each of your experiences with
           the article tag.

           I suppose it seems pretty obvious with your title on the 
           three listings above, but any reason you did not include
           details on your responsibilities? Perhaps you could add
           what kind of subjects you shot for each publication? Perhaps
           it is a chance to show diversity in subject matter?
